# Data Concepts

This document introduces key statistical concepts in a clear and beginner-friendly way

## Averages

An **average** summarises a set of data into a single value which is typical or central
and can therefore represent the whole set of data.

The three most common types are:

- **Mean**  
  The **mean** of a set of numbers in a data set is obtained by adding up all the numbers
  then dividing by the size of the data set.

- **Median**  
  The **median** can be described as the 'middle number'. We can obtain the median by ordering
  the data in terms of size, then:
  - For an odd number of observations, simply take the middle number.
  - For an even number of observations, take the two middle numbers, add them together and divide by 2.

  For a large data set, it is useful to find the position of the median within the data set.
  This is given by (*n* + 1)/2, where *n* is the number of data values in the data set.

- **Mode**  
  The **mode** is the most common number that appears in your set of data. 
  To find the mode count how often each number appears and the number that appears the most times is the mode.

 
## Standard Deviation

The **standard deviation**, often denoted by Ïƒ, is a statistic measuring the dispersion
of a data set relative to its mean. It is calculated as the square root of the variance. 

- A high standard deviation mean that values are generally far from the mean.
- A low standard deviation indicated that values are clustered close to the mean.

## Distributions

A **distribution** refers to how the data is spread out or clustered around 
certain values or ranges. 

- **Normal Distribution**  
  A **normal distribution**, also known as a _Gaussian distribution_
  or _probability bell curve_, is a type of continuous probability distribution in which 
  most data points cluster toward the middle of the range, while the rest taper off 
  symetrically toward either extreme. It is symmetric about the mean.

- **Positive Skew**  
   A distribution is **positively skewed** when most data values are low,
   but a few very high values stretch the graph to the right. 

   In this case:
   - The _mean_ is higher than the _median_.
   - The long tail is on the right side.

- **Negative Skew**  
   A distribution is **negatively skew** when most data values are high, but a few very
   low values stretch the graph to the left. 

   In this case:
   - The mean is lower than the median.
   - The long tail is on the left side.

## Outliers 

An **outlier** is a value in a data set that is _much higher_ or _much lower_ than most
of the other values.

Outliers can affect things like the mean and may show that something unusual is
happening in the data.

They can occur because of errors, rare events, or natural variation. 

## Correlations 

A **correlation** shows whether and how strongly two variables are related.

- If one value increases and the other increases, that's a _positive correlation_.
- If one value decreases and the other increases, that's a _negative correlation_.
- If there is no clear pattern, there's _no correlation_. 

Correlation helps us understand patterns but doesn't prove that one thing causes the other.
