# Data Concepts

This document introduces key statistical concepts in a clear and beginner-friendly way

## Averages

An Average summarises a set of data into a signle value which is typical or central
and can therefore represent the whole set of data.

The three most common types are:

- **Mean**
The **mean** of a set of numbers in a data set is obtained by adding up all the numbers
then dividing by the size of the data set.

- **Median**
The median can be described as the 'middle number'. We can obtain the median by ordering
the data in terms of size, then:
  - For an odd number of observations, simply take the middle number.
  - For an even number of observations, take the two middle numbers, add them together and divide by 2.

For a large data set, it is useful to find the position of the median within the data set.
This is given by (*n* + 1)/2, where *n* is the number of data values in the data set.
