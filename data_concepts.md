# Data Concepts

This document introduces key statistical concepts in a clear and beginner-friendly way

## Averages

An **Average** summarises a set of data into a single value which is typical or central
and can therefore represent the whole set of data.

The three most common types are:

- **Mean**
_The **mean** of a set of numbers in a data set is obtained by adding up all the numbers
then dividing by the size of the data set._

- **Median**
_The **median** can be described as the 'middle number'. We can obtain the median by ordering
the data in terms of size, then:_
  - For an odd number of observations, simply take the middle number.
  - For an even number of observations, take the two middle numbers, add them together and divide by 2.

_For a large data set, it is useful to find the position of the median within the data set.
This is given by (*n* + 1)/2, where *n* is the number of data values in the data set._

- **Mode**
_The **mode** is the most common number that appears in your set of data. 
To find the mode count how often each number appears and the number that appears the most times is the mode._
